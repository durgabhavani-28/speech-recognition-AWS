1️⃣ Speech Recognition AWS
# 🎤 Speech Recognition using AWS

## 📌 Problem Statement
Manual transcription of speech to text is time-consuming and prone to errors.  
There is a need for an **automated, scalable, and accurate speech recognition system** that can process audio recordings and convert them into structured text.

---

## 🎯 Goal / Objective
- Build a **speech-to-text pipeline** using AWS services.  
- Provide a simple **UI** to record/upload audio files.  
- Store and retrieve transcriptions for later use.  

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution
- A Python-based application with HTML interface.  
- Audio files uploaded to **AWS S3**.  
- **AWS Transcribe** processes the file and returns the text.  
- The text is displayed to the user and optionally stored in a database.  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** (Flask / Streamlit)  
- **HTML/CSS** for UI  
- **AWS S3, AWS Transcribe, AWS Lambda**  
- **Boto3 SDK** for Python

🔑 Code Explanation (Snippet)
import boto3

transcribe = boto3.client('transcribe')

job_name = "myTranscriptionJob"
job_uri = "s3://bucket/audio.wav"

transcribe.start_transcription_job(
    TranscriptionJobName=job_name,
    Media={'MediaFileUri': job_uri},
    MediaFormat='wav',
    LanguageCode='en-US'
)
